    Problem
        1. There are infinite number of coins for the given denominations.
        2. Find the minimum no of coins using which the total can match the given amount.

    Algo
        Whenever you come across problems which have multiple levels of recursion,
        take input in such a way, that there is only 1 level of recursive calls.
        For eg: In this problem, if we take denominations as [1,2,3] and amount = 1.

        Diagram
                                    f(coins, 1, 0) = 0 + 1

    f(coins, 0, 0)  (won't be calculated for i=1, returns MAX value)  (won't be calculated for i=2, returns MAX value)




    This problem is like Fibonacci and Stairs problem on steroids.
