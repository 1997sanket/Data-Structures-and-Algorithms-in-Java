1. Analyze the base case.

2. Try to find sub-problems and how they can help construct the main problem.

3. You can either get a part of the solution from sub-problem then solve the main problem, (like fibonacci)
	OR you can solve the current problem and send some data in the sub problem to solve that problem, so eventually when
		base condition is reached, your problem will be solved. (like count steps to convert number to zero - Level 1)
	OR	You can also use a variable outside the function, like a static variable, that can help you solve the problem.
			(like reversing a number in Level 1).

4. Local variables in recursion
	- Argument (remember, the argument variables will also be passed to the recursive function)
	- Return type (fairly simple, what you want to return to the user)
	- body variables (variables that are only used by the current function call)

5. You can also use helper functions in your code, these functions can have more arguments than what the user passed originally.

6. If it's an array question, you can either traverse from 0 to (n-1) or (n-1) to 0. Check which traversal will yield better more
	readable solution.
