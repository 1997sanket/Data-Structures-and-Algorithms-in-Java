1. Make a change, then revert the change. (before the function is returned).

2. All this backtracking and related problems are very similar to the string subsequences "processed" and "unprocessed" problems.

3. You need to keep in mind that, when a function makes supposed four recursion calls, every recursion call will call the 
	first one only, till the base condition is reached.
	And eventually, when all the first calls are finished, the control will come back to the first-ever call, and from there
	the second call will go, and so on.

4. Hint: When to use Backtracking ?
	- When a choice can affect future answers, use BT.
